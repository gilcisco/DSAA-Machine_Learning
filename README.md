## Newland Mission 
Welcome to Newland. In 2044, planet Earth was going through significant and accelerated climate 
changes that became unfeasible for all forms of life. 
Five years earlier, a planet was discovered in our galaxy with conditions similar to those of planet Earth 
and a mission was developed to inhabit the new planet. 
The mission, called "Newland", was launched in 2046, and sent 3 populated spaceships, each with a 
capacity of about 40,000 people, to the new planet. Unfortunately, in the first phase of the mission, 2 
spaceships were reported missing. 
The selection of the people to be sent was also controversial: 
- The majority of the people (volunteers) were carefully chosen through an extensive selection 
process - Group A;
- More than 2500 people were payed to participate in the mission (those were people who have 
been considered by the state has essential people to have on an initial stage) – Group B;
- Around 1500 people payed to participate in the mission (those who were rejected in a selection 
process but entered by making a money offer) – Group C.
In 2048, and with another 100 new spaceships on the way (where the selection criteria remains 
controversial), the Newland government decided that residents should start paying taxes in order to make 
the new city more financially sustainable. They decided to apply a binary tax rate in which for people with 
an income below or equal to the average the rate would be 15% of income and for the remaining people 
30% of their income. The first phase of this process is to identify the people who belong to each class. To 
this end, a first income analysis was made to 32500 people older than 17 years old, from which the 
government intends to create a predictive model to apply to people on their way to Newland. 
Several groups of data scientists (including your group) were invited to create a predictive model based 
on a dataset of 22400 observations. This model will be applied to 10100 new observations (the test 
dataset) from which the government knows the value of income. The group of data scientists who obtain the best performing model will be invited to join the Newland government data science department.
